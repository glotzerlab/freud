Extra examples
==============
This directory contains miscellaneous extra examples of the code.

box_cut.cc - this creates a large Voronoi cell, and then cuts the cell by a
group of points within a small box, to demonstrate space that particles within
a block can possibly affect. Different topologies are visible depending on
whether a face, edge, or corner of the box is aligned with the cell.

cut_region.cc - this program demonstrates the plane_intersects() routine for
determining whether a plane has any intersection with a Voronoi cell. The
program creates a test Voronoi cell, saves it to "cell.gnu", and then maps out
the region of space which can possibly influence it and saves an outline of it
to "cell_cut_region.gnu". These can be visualized in gnuplot using:

splot 'cell.gnu' with lines, 'cell_cut_region.gnu' with dots

superellipsoid.cc - this creates a cell in the shape of a superellipsoid
(satisfying the equation x^4+y^4+z^4=1) and outputs the results in gnuplot
format to "superellipsoid.gnu".

irregular.cc - this code makes use of a wall class as a method of handling a
Voronoi tessellation for an irregular group of particles. Each Voronoi cell is
initialized to be a dodecahedron surronding the particle, which is then cut.
This stops Voronoi cells from extending a long way out to the computational
boundaries. The output can be visualized using the POV-Ray header file
irregular.pov.
