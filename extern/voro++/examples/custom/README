Customized output examples
==========================
The output of Voro++ can be customized to contain a variety of statistics about
the Voronoi cells. Voro++ can also calculated the radical Voronoi tessellation
for polydisperse packings where the cutting plane positions are displaced
according to the particle radii.

1. cell_statistics.cc constructs a simple Voronoi cell, and then demonstrates
the large number of routines in the voronoicell class that will compute
different statistics about the cell.

2. custom_output.cc loads in a small monodisperse packing in a cube of side
length six from the file pack_six_cube. It then uses the basic output routine
print_all() to save the particle positions and Voronoi volumes to the file
packing.standard. The routine print_all_neighbor() is also demonstrated, saving
the particle positions, Voronoi volumes and neighbors to the file
packing.neighbor. Three customized outputs are then created using the
print_all_custom() routine.

3. radical.cc loads in a small monodisperse packing from the file
pack_six_cube, and saves the Voronoi tessellation to pack_six_cube.gnu. It then
loads in a polydisperse packing in the same geometry from the file
pack_six_cube_poly, and it saves the radical Voronoi tessellation to
pack_six_cube_poly.gnu. These can be overlaid in gnuplot using the commands:

set style data lines
splot 'pack_six_cube.gnu', 'pack_six_cube_poly.gnu'
