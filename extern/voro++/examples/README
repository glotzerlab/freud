Voro++ example directory
========================
These directories contain example programs that make use of the Voro++ code,
and they are divided into six sections:

basic - this contains several simple scripts that introduce this basic classes
and carry out simple operations, such as constructing a single cell, or making
a Voronoi tessellation for a small number of a random particles in a box.

walls - these programs demonstrate the use of wall objects, to calculate the
Voronoi cells in non-standard geometries.

custom - these programs demonstrate how to customize the output of the library
to contain a variety of different statistics about the computed Voronoi cells.
The radical tessellation for a polydisperse packing of particles is also
demonstrated.

interface - these programs demonstrate features of the library's C++ interface.

extra - this contains miscellaneous additional applications of the library for
non-standard usage. It also includes an example of using a wall object to
approximately deal with a case of an irregular boundary.

degenerate - these codes demonstrate cases when "degenerate" vertices of order
bigger than 3 are created, when the cutting planes are aligned to existing
vertices within the numerical tolerance.

timing - these programs and scripts can be used to test the performance of the
code under different configurations.
