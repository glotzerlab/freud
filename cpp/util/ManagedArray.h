/*! \file ManagedArray.h
    \brief Defines the standard array class to be used throughout freud.
*/

namespace freud { namespace util {

//! Class to handle the storage of all arrays of numerical data used in freud.
/*! The purpose of this class is to handle standard memory management, and to
 *  provide an abstraction around the implementation-specific choice of
 *  underlying data structure for arrays of data in freud. These arrays are
 *  specifically designed for numerical data calculated by a compute class,
 *  particularly for arrays that must be made accessible through the Python API
 *  of freud. The array shape is stored and used to support multidimensional
 *  indexing.
 *
 *  To support resizing, a ManagedArray instances stores its data as a pointer
 *  to a pointer, and its shape as a pointer. As a result, copy-assignment or
 *  initialization will result in a new ManagedArray pointing to the same data,
 *  and any such array can resize or reallocate this data. The pointer to
 *  pointer infrastructure ensures that such changes properly propagate to all
 *  ManagedArrays referencing a given memory space. In addition, this
 *  infrastructure allows the creation of a completely new ManagedArray with a
 *  new set of pointers that also manages the same data, allowing it to keep
 *  the original array alive if the original ManagedArray instances become
 *  decoupled from it.
 *
 *  Performance notes:
 *      1. The variadic indexers may be a bottleneck if used in
 *         performance-critical code paths. In such cases, directly calling the
 *         overloaded signature using an std::vector is preferable.
 *      2. In situations where multiple identically shaped arrays are being
 *         indexed into, the index may be computed once using the getIndex
 *         function and reused to avoid recomputing it each time.

    // of indices. However, the more convenient approach is enabled using

    // Performance note: the variadic indexers can be expensive
    // since they have to build up a std::vector through a sequence of
    // (hopefully compiler optimized) function calls. In general, this is
    // unimportant since performance critical code paths in freud do not
    // involve large amounts of indexing into ManagedArrays. However, in cases
    // where critical code paths do index into the array, it may be
    // advantageous to directly call the function with a std::vector of indices
    // and bypass the variadic indexers.
