 *  dimensional cases. The PMFT class defines some of the key interfaces required for all PMFT classes, such
 *  as the ability to access the underlying PCF and box. Many of the specific methods must be implemented by
 *  subclasses that account for the proper set of dimensions.The required functions are implemented as pure
 *  virtual functions here to enforce this.

    /*! The pair correlation function is computed by reducing the bin counts in
     * all of the thread local histograms and then multiplying these by the
     * appropriate normalization factor. The normalization is nearly identical
     * to the RDF except for the volume normalization. In the RDF, the volume
     * normalization is simply V_shell/V_total, but in the PFMT the
     * normalization depends on the volume element in the relevant coordinate
     * system. This method accepts a function jf that returns the volume
     * element corresponding to a given bin in the histogram.
     *
     *  **IMPORTANT NOTE**: The inv_num_dens factor in the calculation in this
     *  function is just volume / Np, so it does not include volume elements in
     *  the orientational degrees of freedom. This means that the corresponding
     *  normalization factors *should not* be applied to the Jacobian factor
     *  argument. For instance, any full-dimensional PMFT in 2D must contain at
     *  least one angular term, but that term should not contain a factor of
     *  2*PI since that factor is effectively divided out of the volume here.
     *
     *  \param JacobFactor A function with one parameter (the histogram bin index) that returns the volume of
     * the element in the histogram bin corresponding to the index.
