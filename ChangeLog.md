### Changed
* LocalWl return values are real instead of complex.

### Fixed
* Fixed missing Condon-Shortley phase affecting LocalWl and Steinhardt Wl
  computations. This missing factor of -1 caused results for third-order (Wl)
  Steinhardt order parameters to be incorrect, shown by their lack of
  rotational invariance. This problem was introduced in v0.5.0.

### Fixed
* Fixed bug resulting in the `LocalQlNear` and `LocalWlNear` class wrongly
  using a hard instead of a soft cut-off, which may have resulted in an
  incorrect number of neighbors. This would cause incorrect results especially
  for systems with an average n-th nearest-neighbor distance smaller than
  `rmax`. This problem was introduced in v0.6.4.
* Fixed duplicate neighbors found by `LinkCell` `NeighborQuery` methods
* Corrected data in `LocalQl`, `LocalWl` documentation example
