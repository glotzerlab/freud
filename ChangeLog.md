### Changed

### Fixed
* Fixed missing Condon-Shortley phase affecting LocalWl and Steinhardt Wl
  computations. This missing factor of -1 caused results for third-order (Wl)
  Steinhardt order parameters to be incorrect, shown by their lack of
  rotational invariance. This problem was introduced in v0.5.0.
