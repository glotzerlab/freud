# Minkowski Structure Metrics Validations

Data files in this folder come from [this repository](https://github.com/ArvDee/Minkowski-structure-metrics-calculator/tree/master/testLattices) with work by Robin van Damme.

## Data Description

> Both the averaged and the non-averaged output Minkowski structure metrics should match the Steinhardt bond order parameters for the simple cubic (SC), face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattices, whose values are reported in Table 1 of Ref. [1].
> The BCC will not match the Steinhardt case, as the definition of the neighbours differs between the two.
> Two reference values for the Minkowski structure metrics of the BCC lattice are reported in Ref 2, section IIc.
>
> For each lattice there are 4 files that can be used: either a unit cell or a large lattice, and either in .dat or in .gsd format.
> All these should provide the same results.
