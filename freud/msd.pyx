cdef class MSD(_Compute):
    R"""Compute the mean squared displacement.

    The mean squared displacement (MSD) measures how much particles move over
    time. The MSD plays an important role in characterizing Brownian motion,
    since it provides a measure of whether particles are moving according to
    diffusion alone or if there are other forces contributing. There are a
    number of definitions for the mean squared displacement. This function
    provides access to the two most common definitions through the mode
    argument.

    * :code:`'window'` (*default*):
      This mode calculates the most common form of the MSD, which is defined as

      .. math::

          MSD(m) = \frac{1}{N_{particles}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{particles}} \frac{1}{N-m} \sum_{k=0}^{N-m-1} (\vec{r}_i(k+m) - \vec{r}_i(k))^2

      where :math:`r_i(t)` is the position of particle :math:`i` in frame
      :math:`t`. According to this definition, the mean squared displacement is
      the average displacement over all windows of length :math:`m` over the
      course of the simulation. Therefore, for any :math:`m`, :math:`MSD(m)` is
      averaged over all windows of length :math:`m` and over all particles.
      This calculation can be accessed using the 'window' mode of this
      function.

      The windowed calculation can be quite computationally intensive. To
      perform this calculation efficiently, we use the algorithm described in
      :cite:`calandrini2011nmoldyn` as described in `this StackOverflow thread
      <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34222272/computing-mean-square-displacement-using-python-and-fft>`_.

      .. note::
          The most intensive part of this calculation is computing an FFT. To
          maximize performance, freud attempts to use the fastest FFT library
          available. By default, the order of preference is `pyFFTW
          <https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW>`_, SciPy, and then NumPy. If you
          are experiencing significant slowdowns in calculating the MSD, you
          may benefit from installing a faster FFT library, which freud will
          automatically detect. The performance change will be especially
          noticeable if the length of your trajectory is a number whose prime
          factorization consists of extremely large prime factors. The
          standard Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm performs very poorly in this
          case, so installing pyFFTW will significantly improve performance.

          Note that while pyFFTW is released under the BSD 3-Clause license,
          the FFTW library is available under either GPL or a commercial
          license.

    * :code:`'direct'`:
      Under some circumstances, however, we may be more interested in
      calculating a different quantity described by

      .. math::
          :nowrap:

          \begin{eqnarray*}
              MSD(t) =& \dfrac{1}{N_{particles}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{particles}} (r_i(t) - r_i(0))^2 \\
          \end{eqnarray*}

      In this case, at each time point (i.e. simulation frame) we simply
      compute how much particles have moved from their initial position,
      averaged over all particles. For more information on this calculation,
      see `the Wikipedia page
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_displacement>`_.

    .. note::
        The MSD is only well-defined when the box is constant over the
        course of the simulation. Additionally, the number of particles must be
        constant over the course of the simulation.

            Unlike most methods in freud, accumulation for the MSD is split

            this choice is that efficient computation of the MSD requires using
            the entire trajectory for a given particle. As a result, when setting
            ``reset=False``, you must provide the positions of each point over

            multiple times with different subsets the points to calculate the
