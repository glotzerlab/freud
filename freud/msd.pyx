cdef class MSD:
    R"""Compute the mean squared displacement.

    The mean squared displacement (MSD) measures how much particles move over
    time. The MSD plays an important role in characterizing Brownian motion,
    since it provides a measure of whether particles are moving according to
    diffusion alone or if there are other forces contributing. There are a
    number of definitions for the mean squared displacement. This function
    provides access to the two most common definitions through the mode
    argument.

    * :code:`'window'` (*default*):
      This mode calculates the most common form of the MSD, which is defined as

      .. math::

          MSD(m) = \left\langle\frac{1}{N-m} \sum_{k=0}^{N-m-1} (\vec{r}(k+m) - \vec{r}(k))^2\right\rangle_{particles}

      According to this definition, the mean squared displacement is the
      average displacement over all windows of length :math:`m` over the course
      of the simulation. Therefore, for any :math:`m`, :math:`MSD(m)` is
      averaged over all windows of length :math:`m` and over all particles.
      This calculation can be accessed using the 'window' mode of this
      function.

      The windowed calculation can be quite computationally intensive. To
      perform this calculation efficiently, we use the algorithm described in
      [Calandrini2011]_ as described in `this StackOverflow thread
      <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34222272/computing-mean-square-displacement-using-python-and-fft>`_.

    * :code:`'direct'`:
      Under some circumstances, however, we may be more interested in
      calculating a different quantity described by

      .. math::
          :nowrap:

          \begin{eqnarray*}
              MSD(t) = &\langle (\vec{r}-\vec{r}_0)^2 \rangle_{particles} \\
                     = & \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N (x_n(t) - x_n(0))^2 \\
          \end{eqnarray*}

      In this case, we simply compute how much particles have moved from their
      initial position, averaged over all particles. For more information on
      this calculation, see `the Wikipedia page
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_displacement>`_.

    .. note::
        The MSD is only well-defined when the box is constant over the
        course of the simulation. Additionally, the number of particles must be
        constant over the course of the simulation.

            Unlike most methods in freud, accumulation for the MSD is split
            over particles rather than frames of a simulation. The reason for
            this choice is that efficient computation of the MSD requires using
            the entire trajectory for a given particle. As a result, this
