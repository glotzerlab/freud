Installing freud
================

The **freud** library can be installed via `conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/>`_ or pip, or compiled from source.

Install via conda
-----------------

The code below will install **freud** from `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/freud>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge freud

Install via pip
-----------------

The code below will install **freud** from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/freud-analysis/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install freud-analysis

Compile from source
-------------------

The following are **required** for installing **freud**:

- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (3.5+ required)
- `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_
- `Intel Threading Building Blocks <https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ (TBB)
- `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ (0.29+ required)

The following are **optional** for installing **freud**:


For conda users, these requirements can be met by installing the following packages from the `conda-forge channel <https://conda-forge.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge tbb tbb-devel numpy cython

The code that follows builds **freud** and installs it for all users (append ``--user`` if you wish to install it to your user site directory):

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud.git
    cd freud
    python setup.py install

You can also build **freud** in place so that you can run from within the folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run tests from the tests directory
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Building **freud** in place has certain advantages, since it does not affect your Python behavior except within the **freud** directory itself (where **freud** can be imported after building).
Additionally, due to limitations inherent to the distutils/setuptools infrastructure, building extension modules can only be parallelized using the build_ext subcommand of setup.py, not with install.
As a result, it will be faster to manually run build_ext and then install (which normally calls build_ext under the hood anyway) the built packages.
In general, the following options are available for setup.py in addition to the standard setuptools options (notes are included to indicate which options are only available for specific subcommands such as build_ext):

.. glossary::

    -\\-PRINT-WARNINGS
      Specify whether or not to print compilation warnings resulting from the build even if the build succeeds with no errors.

    -j
      Compile in parallel.
      This affects both the generation of C++ files from Cython files and the subsequent compilation of the source files.
      In the latter case, this option controls the number of Python modules that will be compiled in parallel.

    -\\-TBB-ROOT
      The root directory where TBB is installed.
      Useful if TBB is installed in a non-standard location or cannot be located by Python for some other reason.
      Note that this information can also be provided using the environment variable ``TBB_ROOT``.
      The options ``--TBB-INCLUDE`` and ``--TBB-LINK`` will take precedence over ``--TBB-ROOT`` if both are specified.

    -\\-TBB-INCLUDE
      The directory where the TBB headers (e.g. ``tbb.h``) are located.
      Useful if TBB is installed in a non-standard location or cannot be located by Python for some other reason.
      Note that this information can also be provided using the environment variable ``TBB_ROOT``.
      The options ``--TBB-INCLUDE`` and ``--TBB-LINK`` will take precedence over ``--TBB-ROOT`` if both are specified.

    -\\-TBB-LINK
      The directory where the TBB shared library (e.g. ``libtbb.so`` or ``libtbb.dylib``) is located.
      Useful if TBB is installed in a non-standard location or cannot be located by Python for some other reason.
      Note that this information can also be provided using the environment variable ``TBB_ROOT``.
      The options ``--TBB-INCLUDE`` and ``--TBB-LINK`` will take precedence over ``--TBB-ROOT`` if both are specified.

The following additional arguments are primarily useful for developers:

.. glossary::

    -\\-COVERAGE
      Build the Cython files with coverage support to check unit test coverage.

    -\\-NTHREAD
      Specify the number of threads to allocate to compiling each module.
      This option is primarily useful for rapid development, particularly when all changes are in one module.
      While the ``-j`` option will not help parallelize this case, this option allows compilation of multiple source files belonging to the same module in parallel.

.. note::

    **freud** makes use of git submodules. If you ever wish to manually update these, you can execute:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git submodule update --init

Unit Tests
==========

The unit tests for **freud** are included in the repository and are configured to be run using the Python :mod:`unittest` library:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run tests from the tests directory
    cd tests
    python -m unittest discover .

Note that because **freud** is designed to require installation to run (i.e. it cannot be run directly out of the build directory), importing **freud** from the root of the repository will fail because it will try and import the package folder.
As a result, unit tests must be run from outside the root directory if you wish to test the installed version of **freud**.
If you want to run tests within the root directory, you can instead build **freud** in place:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run tests from the tests directory
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This build will place the necessary files alongside the **freud** source files so that **freud** can be imported from the root of the repository.

Documentation
=============

The documentation for **freud** is `hosted online at ReadTheDocs <https://freud.readthedocs.io/>`_.
You may also build the documentation yourself.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The following are **required** for building **freud** documentation:

- `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_
- `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `nbsphinx <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `jupyter_sphinx <https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `sphinxcontrib-bibtex <https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/>`_

You can install these dependencies using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme nbsphinx jupyter_sphinx sphinxcontrib-bibtex

or pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme nbsphinx jupyter-sphinx sphinxcontrib-bibtex

To build the documentation, run the following commands in the source directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    make html
    # Then open build/html/index.html

To build a PDF of the documentation (requires LaTeX and/or PDFLaTeX):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    make latexpdf
    # Then open build/latex/freud.pdf
