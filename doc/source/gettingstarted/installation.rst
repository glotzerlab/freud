Installing freud
================

The **freud** library can be installed via `conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/>`_ or pip, or compiled from source.

Install via conda
-----------------

The code below will install **freud** from `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/freud>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge freud

Install via pip
-----------------

The code below will install **freud** from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/freud-analysis/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install freud-analysis

Compile from source
-------------------

The following are **required** for installing **freud**:

- A C++14-compliant compiler
- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ (>=3.6)
- `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`__ (>=1.14)
- `Intel Threading Building Blocks <https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`__ (>=2017.03.R2)
- `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__ (>=0.29.14)
- `scikit-build <https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/>`__ (>=0.10.0)
- `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ (>=3.12.0)

.. note::

    Depending on the generator you are using, you may require a newer version of CMake.
    In particular, Visual Studio 2019 requires CMake >= 3.14.0.
    For more information on specific generators, see the `CMake generator documentation <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/manual/cmake-generators.7.html>`__.

The **freud** library uses scikit-build and CMake to handle the build process itself, while the other requirements are required for compiling code in **freud**.
These requirements can be met by installing the following packages from the `conda-forge channel <https://conda-forge.org/>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge tbb tbb-devel numpy cython scikit-build cmake

All requirements other than TBB can also be installed via the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`__

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numpy cython scikit-build cmake

Wheels for tbb and tbb-devel exist on PyPI, but only for certain operating systems, so your mileage may vary.
For non-conda users, we recommend using OS-specific package managers (e.g. `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ for Mac) to install TBB.
As in the snippets above, it may be necessary to install both both a TBB and a "devel" package in order to get both the headers and the shared libraries.

The code that follows builds **freud** and installs it for all users (append ``--user`` if you wish to install it to your user site directory):

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud.git
    cd freud
    python setup.py install

You can also build **freud** in place so that you can run from within the folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run tests from the tests directory
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Building **freud** in place has certain advantages, since it does not affect your Python behavior except within the **freud** directory itself (where **freud** can be imported after building).

CMake Options
+++++++++++++

The scikit-build tool allows setup.py to accept three different sets of options separated by ``--``, where each set is provided directly to scikit-build, to CMake, or to the code generator of choice, respectively.
For example, the command ``python setup.py build_ext --inplace -- -DCOVERAGE=ON -G Ninja -- -j 4`` tell scikit-build to perform an in-place build, it tells CMake to turn on the ``COVERAGE`` option and use Ninja for compilation, and it tells Ninja to compile with 4 parallel threads.
For more information on these options, see the `scikit-build docs <scikit-build.readthedocs.io/>`__.

.. note::

    The default CMake build configuration for freud is ``ReleaseWithDocs`` (not a standard build configuration like ``Release`` or ``RelWithDebInfo``).
    On installation, ``setup.py`` assumes ``--build-type=ReleaseWithDocs`` by default if no build type is specified.
    Using this build configuration is a workaround for `this issue <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/issues/518>`__ with scikit-build and Cython embedding docstrings.

In addition to standard CMake flags, the following CMake options are available for **freud**:

.. glossary::

    \--COVERAGE
      Build the Cython files with coverage support to check unit test coverage.


The **freud** CMake configuration also respects the following environment variables (in addition to standards like ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``).

.. glossary::

    TBBROOT
      The root directory where TBB is installed.
      Useful if TBB is installed in a non-standard location or cannot be located for some other reason.
      This variable is set by the ``tbbvars.sh`` script included with TBB when building from source.

    TBB_INCLUDE_DIR
      The directory where the TBB headers (e.g. ``tbb.h``) are located.
      Useful if TBB is installed in a non-standard location or cannot be located for some other reason.

.. note::

    **freud** makes use of git submodules. To manually update git submodules, execute:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git submodule update --init --recursive

Unit Tests
==========

The unit tests for **freud** are included in the repository and are configured to be run using the Python :mod:`pytest` library:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run tests from the tests directory
    cd tests
    python -m pytest .

Note that because **freud** is designed to require installation to run (i.e. it cannot be run directly out of the build directory), importing **freud** from the root of the repository will fail because it will try and import the package folder.
As a result, unit tests must be run from outside the root directory if you wish to test the installed version of **freud**.
If you want to run tests within the root directory, you can instead build **freud** in place:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run tests from the tests directory
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This build will place the necessary files alongside the **freud** source files so that **freud** can be imported from the root of the repository.

Documentation
=============

The documentation for **freud** is `hosted online at ReadTheDocs <https://freud.readthedocs.io/>`_.
You may also build the documentation yourself.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The following are **required** for building **freud** documentation:

- `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_
- `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `nbsphinx <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `jupyter_sphinx <https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `sphinxcontrib-bibtex <https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/>`_

You can install these dependencies using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme nbsphinx jupyter_sphinx sphinxcontrib-bibtex

or pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme nbsphinx jupyter-sphinx sphinxcontrib-bibtex

To build the documentation, run the following commands in the source directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    make html
    # Then open build/html/index.html

To build a PDF of the documentation (requires LaTeX and/or PDFLaTeX):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    make latexpdf
    # Then open build/latex/freud.pdf
