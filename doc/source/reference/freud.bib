@article{Karas2019,
    Abstract = {Plastic crystals -- like liquid crystals -- are mesophases that can exist between liquids and crystals and possess some of the characteristic traits of each of these states of matter. Plastic crystals exhibit translational order but orientational disorder. Here{,} we characterize the phase behavior in systems of hard polyhedra that self-assemble plastic face-centered cubic (pFCC) colloidal crystals. We report a first-order transition from a pFCC to a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) crystal{,} a smooth crossover from pFCC to an orientationally-ordered FCC crystal{,} and an apparent orientational glass transition wherein long-range order fails to develop from a plastic crystal upon an increase in density. Using global order parameters and local environment descriptors{,} we describe how particle shape influences the development of orientational order with increasing density{,} and we provide design rules based on the arrangement of facets for engineering plastic crystal behavior in colloidal systems.},

It is primarily designed for applications in physics and materials science, where the Voronoi tessellation can be a useful tool in the analysis of densely-packed particle systems, such as granular materials or glasses. The software comprises of several C++ classes that can be modified and incorporated into other programs. A command-line utility is also provided that can use most features of the code. Voro++ makes use of a direct cell-by-cell construction, which is particularly suited to handling special boundary conditions and walls. It employs algorithms which are tolerant for numerical precision errors, and it has been successfully employed on very large particle systems.},
